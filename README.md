# RUNNING THE CODE 

By running, compiling, and executing the main method (main.cpp) in the aforementioned files, the code can be tested. 
You may now compile the code by uncommenting the final three lines in the main.cpp file. 
To determine the number of stops and ideal distance for the main method, a route was examined. 
The path was: from Winnipeg, Canada, to Accra, Ghana. Output.txt is the name of the file's output.
